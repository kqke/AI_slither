The project is composed of 2 parts: 
- The Game
- The Players


===========           
= The Game =        
===========    
The consists of an nxn board, with food placed randomly on different tiles of the board, and snakes (the players) moving around
 the board trying to eat food and avoid obstacles (e.g other snakes' bodies).      

============           
= The Players =        
============    
We implemented 5 different types of players:
 - Manual (Human) Player - a human player controls the actions of the snake
 - Random Player - a snake that performs random actions with no strategy
 - Greedy Player - a snake that attempts to eat the food closest to it while trying to avoid obstacles in its way
 - Neural Network (NN) Player - a snake which uses a NN to learn how to play the game by trying to approximate the Q-Function 
 of the game
 - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Player - a snake which uses a CNN to learn how to play the game by trying to approximate the Q-Function 
 of the game
